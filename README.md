## 🚀 About Me

I am a motivated Full Stack Developer with strong foundations in backend architecture, distributed systems, and modern web technologies. I build scalable applications using React, Node.js, Express, and MySQL.

I have hands-on experience developing smart contracts using Solidity and building decentralized applications tested locally using Ganache and Truffle.

I’m passionate about secure system design, clean architecture, and integrating intelligent features into real-world applications.
